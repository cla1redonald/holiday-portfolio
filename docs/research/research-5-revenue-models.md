# Holiday Portfolio — Revenue Models & Unit Economics Research
**Research Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Deep competitive analysis of travel platform revenue mechanics to inform Holiday Portfolio's monetisation strategy

---

## Part 1: Competitor Revenue Models — Deep Dive

### 1.1 LoveHolidays

**Scale:** £2.9bn GTV sold in FY2024 (Nov 2023–Oct 2024), £288M revenue, £83M adjusted EBITDA. Over 5 million ATOL passenger seats. Tipped for £1bn IPO valuation in early 2026.

**How they actually make money:**

LoveHolidays operates as an ATOL-licensed package holiday OTA. The key mechanic is **implicit markup on flight + hotel combinations**, not a transparent commission line. They do not buy and hold inventory — they dynamically package Ryanair flights (50%+ of holidays) with hotel beds sourced from wholesalers (Hotelbeds, etc.), then sell the package at a margin.

Implied take rate: £288M revenue on £2.9bn GTV = **~9.9% take rate** on gross transaction value. This is notably lower than pure hotel OTAs (Booking.com runs ~16%) because flights generate minimal commission — LoveHolidays' package margin comes almost entirely from **hotel markup, not flight commission**.

Revenue per booking (estimated): At 5M passengers and average 2 per booking, that's ~2.5M bookings. £288M / 2.5M = **~£115 revenue per booking**. Average package value at £2.9bn / 2.5M = **~£1,160 per booking**, implying ~10% net take per booking.

**EBITDA margin: 28.8%** (£83M / £288M) — extraordinarily high for a consumer travel OTA. This is achieved through:
- Zero inventory risk (dynamic packaging, no pre-committed beds)
- Ryanair Zero API fee (no flight distribution cost)
- Predominantly digital/performance marketing (no retail stores)
- ATOL trust structure means customer money pre-funds the holiday

**Ancillaries:** Car hire, airport parking, transfers, travel insurance — all sold via affiliate/commission at checkout. Typically 8-15% commission on ~£30-80 ancillary value per booking. Estimated £5-15 per booking incremental.

**Revenue per user (estimated):** LoveHolidays claims 191% revenue growth vs 2019, suggesting rapid new customer acquisition. Repeat booking rate is low in package holidays (1-2x per year). Estimated annual revenue per active booker: £115-£230 (1-2 holidays/year).

**Why the EBITDA is so high:** Dynamic packaging means they capture the spread between wholesale hotel rates and retail package prices without carrying any inventory risk. The Ryanair deal eliminates what was previously a significant flight GDS/API cost. ATOL compliance is a moat (competitors need capital/licence).

### 1.2 On The Beach (OTB)

**Scale:** £119.2M revenue FY2024 (up from £106.1M FY2023). LSE-listed. Profits surged 20% to £35M in FY2024.

**Revenue model:**

OTB is the UK's second-largest online package holiday specialist. Like LoveHolidays, they dynamically package flights (sourced from GDS/APIs) with hotels (from accommodation wholesalers). Revenue is the **margin between what customers pay and what OTB pays suppliers**.

Key metric from FY2023: **£209 margin per booking** (up from £192 in FY2022). This is OTB's revenue per transaction — what they keep after paying the flight and hotel costs. FY2024 continued this trend with ABV up 2% despite deflationary pressures.

OTB's **strategic positioning shift:** Moving up-market to premium/luxury/5-star and long-haul, which generate significantly higher margin per booking than budget beach holidays. A 5-star booking might generate £350+ margin vs £150 for a budget deal.

**ATOL mechanics:** All ATOL customer receipts are held in trust until the holiday departs. This means OTB does **not** use customer prepayments as working capital — it's ring-fenced. This is both a regulatory requirement and a trust signal, but it means OTB's cash conversion cycle is long.

**Revenue composition:**
- Core package margin: ~85% of revenue
- Ancillaries (insurance, transfers, car hire): ~15% of revenue
- OTB Beach (in-destination activity/hotel upgrades): Growing segment

**EBITDA margin:** ~29% (£35M on £119M) — comparable to LoveHolidays, confirming the dynamic packaging model generates strong unit economics when scaled.

**Revenue per user:** OTB has ~5M registered users. At £119M revenue / 5M users = **~£24 revenue per registered user per year**. But active bookers (those who book in a given year) generate £200+ per booking. Most registered users don't book every year.

### 1.3 Jet2holidays

**Scale:** £6,255M total revenue FY2024 (+24% YoY). Profit before tax £529M (+43%). 9.3M total passengers, 6.4M package holiday passengers.

**Revenue model — vertical integration:**

Jet2 is the most important model to understand because it demonstrates what vertical integration does to unit economics. They own the airline (Jet2.com) AND the holiday business (Jet2holidays).

**The key insight:** A flight-only passenger generates ~£18 profit. A package holiday passenger generates ~£98 profit — 5.4x more. This is why Jet2 aggressively drives 68.3% of seats into package holidays (up from 64.9% prior year).

**How it works:**
- Jet2.com (airline) sells the seat to Jet2holidays at an internal transfer price
- Jet2holidays packages the seat with hotels sourced from its own contracting team (not wholesalers)
- The package is sold at retail, capturing the full margin chain
- Jet2holidays employs destination-based resort reps (a physical service layer no pure-OTA can match)

**Ancillary revenue:** Jet2.com generates **£89.99 ancillary revenue per passenger** (one of the highest in Europe). This includes:
- Seat assignment, baggage, meals: ~£30-40/passenger
- Car hire, hotel upgrades, insurance, airport lounges: ~£40-50/passenger
- In-destination spending via Jet2holidays extras: included in the £98/passenger package margin

**Why Jet2 is growing:** The integrated model means:
1. No GDS distribution cost (own airline = no flight API fees)
2. Direct hotel contracting (better rates than wholesaler-sourced OTAs)
3. Higher loyalty (own brand throughout the journey)
4. ATOL compliance via own airline licence

**EBIT margin:** ~8.5% on £6.3bn revenue — lower than OTB/LoveHolidays in percentage terms, but the absolute profit (£529M) is enormous, and the model is more defensible.

### 1.4 Going.com (formerly Scott's Cheap Flights)

**Scale:** 2M+ subscribers. Revenue estimated at $25-100M (most cited: $3.8M from early Latka data, but the company has grown significantly — 100% YoY growth rate claimed).

**Revenue model:**

Going is almost entirely a **subscription business** for flight deal alerts. Three tiers:
- **Limited (free):** No international deals (as of Feb 2024 — this tier was deliberately restricted to drive paid conversion)
- **Premium:** $49/year — the main conversion target
- **Elite:** $199/year — premium fare class deals, business/first class error fares

Revenue composition:
- ~95%+ from subscription fees
- Small affiliate commission from flight bookings referred (but this is secondary — Going does not book flights itself; it sends deal alerts that users act on directly with airlines/OTAs)

**Conversion dynamics:** The freemium-to-paid funnel is the core mechanic. By removing international deals from the free tier in February 2024, Going created a clear value demonstration (users see deal alerts they can't access) that drives upgrade. Travel apps have the **highest trial-to-paid conversion rate of any app category at 48.7%** (RevenueCat 2025 data), suggesting the segment converts well.

**Why the model works:** Going's marginal cost per subscriber is near-zero. The team finds deals (mix of algorithms + human curation), and email/app delivery costs are negligible per subscriber. A subscriber paying $49/year with near-zero marginal service cost delivers extraordinary gross margins (likely 80%+).

**What it doesn't do well:** Going monetises the discovery phase only. It cannot monetise the booking — it refers out. This means no take rate on actual transactions, no ancillary revenue, no LTV from repeat bookings.

**Relevance to Holiday Portfolio:** Going demonstrates the subscription model's ceiling — even with millions of subscribers, revenue is capped by subscription ARPU unless you can capture the booking.

### 1.5 Secret Escapes

**Scale:** £170M total revenue FY2023 (underlying £104.1M — the difference reflects gross vs net accounting). 62M global members. Recovered to operating profit in FY2023 after pandemic losses.

**Revenue model — flash sale mechanics:**

Secret Escapes operates a **members-only flash sale** model for luxury and boutique hotels. The mechanics:

1. Secret Escapes negotiates deeply discounted rates with hotels (often 20-40% below retail) in exchange for:
   - Guaranteed minimum room night purchases (revenue guarantee to hotel)
   - Exposure to Secret Escapes' 62M member database
   - Short sale window (typically 7 days) creating urgency

2. Secret Escapes sells these rooms to members at discounts that are still below normal OTA rates but above Secret Escapes' cost

3. Revenue = **net margin between what members pay and what Secret Escapes paid the hotel**

**Commission/margin structure:** The company's affiliate programme pays 3.2% on referred sales — suggesting their own gross margin on sales is materially higher than 3.2%. Industry analysis suggests flash sale luxury hotel margins run **15-25% on transaction value** (lower than standard OTA hotel margins because the hotel has already discounted the rate).

**Why margins are thin despite high revenue:** The reported £170M total vs £104M underlying suggests significant pass-through costs. Flash sale luxury is structurally challenged:
- Hotels demand guaranteed minimums (demand risk on Secret Escapes)
- Marketing costs to re-engage 62M largely-dormant members are high
- The "flash" mechanic requires constant new deal sourcing and editorial curation
- Premium placement fees from hotels add revenue but add complexity

**Revenue per member:** £104M / 62M members = **£1.68 per member per year** — shockingly low. This reveals the core problem: most members never book. Secret Escapes has a massive dormant member base that drives awareness but not revenue. Active bookers (perhaps 2-5% of the base) generate £100-400 per transaction at 20% margin.

**B2B / White-label:** Secret Escapes operates flash sale platforms for partner brands (financial services, loyalty programmes) — an underreported revenue stream that improves unit economics.

### 1.6 Luxury Escapes

**Scale:** Australian flash sale + booking platform. One of the world's fastest-growing travel sites. 500,000+ members (though growing). Revenue estimated at $100M+ AUD range.

**Revenue model:**

Luxury Escapes is a hybrid — part flash sale (Secret Escapes-style limited time offers), part full booking OTA. Key characteristics:

- Packages with hotels include **VIP inclusions** (meals, spa credits, room upgrades) — these extras make price comparison difficult, protecting margins
- Sale windows of ~7 days create urgency without requiring permanent discounting
- Hotel commission similar to standard OTA rates (15-25%) PLUS significant marketing spend on behalf of hotel partners (unlike Booking.com which charges extra for visibility)
- Travel agents now get access to commissionable rates via Agent Hub (2024 change) — expanding distribution

**What differentiates it from Secret Escapes:** Luxury Escapes is more booking-focused (you can book, not just enquire), has stronger curation, and operates more like a premium OTA with flash sale merchandising rather than a pure flash sale club.

**B2B channel (2024):** The Agent Hub launch in Jan 2024 gives Australian travel agents access to commissionable Luxury Escapes rates — a direct B2B revenue stream that didn't previously exist.

### 1.7 Hopper — The Fintech Travel Model

**Scale:** $850M revenue FY2024 (+21.4% YoY). $7.5B annual bookings. 35M users. $5B valuation (2022 secondary market). Backed by Capital One, airlines, and Canadian PE.

**The fundamental shift:** Hopper transformed from a flight price prediction app into a **travel fintech company** that happens to also sell flights and hotels. In 2022, 70% of all air revenues came from fintech products. By 2024, 40% of $7.5B GMV comes from fintech products.

**How Price Freeze works financially:**

Price Freeze is structured as an **options contract on a travel price**:

1. User finds a flight at £400. They want to buy later but fear price increase.
2. Hopper charges a non-refundable deposit (average ~$30) to freeze the price for 1-14 days
3. If price rises: Hopper covers up to $100 of the difference. User pays the frozen price.
4. If price falls: User pays the lower price (Price Freeze deposit acts as credit toward booking)
5. If user doesn't book: Deposit is forfeited (usually — exceptions for cancellations)

**The financial model:**
- Hopper is acting as an options writer (selling price protection)
- The $30 premium is pure revenue if the user doesn't book or if prices don't rise beyond $100
- Hopper uses its proprietary price prediction model (trained on trillions of historical fare data points) to price risk accurately
- When prices rise sharply, Hopper absorbs the loss — but their model predicts this infrequently enough to be profitable
- Average user saves $80 when using Price Freeze — suggesting Hopper's payout averages ~$80 when triggered
- At $30 premium and ~$80 expected payout when triggered, profitability depends on trigger rate being <37.5%

**Cancel for Any Reason (CFAR):**
- Cost: 40-60% premium over standard travel insurance (typical CFAR policy ~$79 for a $2,500 trip)
- Reimbursement: 75-80% of non-refundable costs if cancelled for any reason ≥2 days before departure
- CFAR reached 10% adoption rate across the industry in 2025 — growing fast
- Hopper expanded CFAR from flights to hotels in 2024
- Margin structure: Hopper is the front-end; underwriting is via insurance partners. Hopper earns a distribution fee/commission (likely 20-40% of premium) while the insurer carries the actuarial risk

**Revenue breakdown (estimated):**
- Booking commission (flights, hotels): ~$500M (60% of revenue)
- Price Freeze revenue: ~$100M+ (attach rate 30%+ × $30 × 35M users × booking frequency)
- CFAR and other insurance: ~$100M
- Disruption protection, rebooking guarantee: ~$50M
- HTS B2B licensing: ~$100M+

**Hopper Technology Solutions (HTS) — the B2B play:**

HTS is Hopper's white-label fintech arm, licensing its Price Freeze, CFAR, rebooking guarantee, and price prediction products to other travel companies, banks, and credit cards. Notable clients: Nubank (Brazil), Commonwealth Bank (Australia), Uber UK.

HTS accounts for **75% of the Hopper business** by some measures, and already exceeded 60% of revenue just 18 months after launch. HTS reaches 100M+ consumers globally through partners. B2B fintech SaaS pricing is typically per-product-transaction or revenue share.

**Key metrics:**
- Fintech attach rate: 60%+ of users purchase at least one fintech product (2022 data)
- Average fintech products per booking: 1.7
- Revenue per user: ~$24 (based on $850M / 35M users)
- But active bookers likely generate $100-200 in revenue per booking event

### 1.8 Mindtrip

**Scale:** $22.5M total funding (Capital One Ventures, United Airlines Ventures invested in final round). AI trip planning + booking platform. No public revenue figures — almost certainly pre-revenue or very early revenue.

**Revenue model:**

Mindtrip is a **conversational AI travel planner** that aims to generate revenue through:
1. Affiliate commissions from bookings via Priceline (flights/hotels) and Viator (activities)
2. Partnerships with destination marketing organisations (DMOs)
3. No current subscription revenue

The Capital One and United Airlines investment is strategic — both want access to Mindtrip's booking/planning data and to influence how their products are surfaced in AI recommendations. This suggests a **B2B data/partnership model** alongside consumer affiliate revenue.

**The monetisation challenge for AI trip planners:** Users love planning in conversational AI, but there's a conversion gap between "plan" and "book" — users often plan with one tool and book elsewhere. Mindtrip's Priceline partnership attempts to close this gap with in-platform booking.

**Revenue estimate:** Likely <$5M in revenue currently. The $22.5M funding suggests investors are betting on the platform growing its booking volume significantly before monetisation becomes the focus.

### 1.9 TripIt

**Scale:** 20M+ users. Owned by SAP Concur since 2014. Revenue modest (~$20K/month reported, though this may be outdated).

**Why TripIt cannot monetise bookings:**

TripIt is a **trip organiser/itinerary manager**, not a booking engine. Users forward confirmation emails to plans@tripit.com; TripIt parses them into a unified itinerary. There is no booking path — TripIt sees the trip *after* it's booked.

Revenue model:
- **TripIt Pro** subscription: ~$49/year for real-time alerts (flight changes, gate changes, delays), refund monitoring, points/miles tracking. This is a modest SaaS layer on top of a free tool.
- **Enterprise/B2B (via SAP Concur):** TripIt is deeply integrated into SAP's expense/travel management platform. The B2B revenue from this integration is likely the majority of TripIt's actual commercial value — but it's invisible in consumer metrics.

**Why 20M users generates minimal revenue:** The post-booking nature of TripIt means it has no leverage over booking decisions. Users have already committed by the time TripIt sees the trip. Advertising to users at this stage is low-value (they've just spent money on travel; they're not in shopping mode). The Pro subscription converts a small fraction of free users.

**The lesson for Holiday Portfolio:** Owning the preference and discovery phase (before booking) is commercially far more valuable than owning the post-booking organisation phase. TripIt's 20M users are monetised at <$1/user/year; LoveHolidays generates £115 per *booking*.

### 1.10 Wanderlog

**Scale:** $1M ARR. 5 employees. Hit $1M ARR in June 2024. $1.5M seed funding from General Catalyst and Abstract.

**Revenue model:**

Wanderlog is a collaborative trip planning app. Revenue streams:
1. **Pro subscription:** $79.99/year — unlocks offline access, route optimisation, live flight updates, AI assistance. This is the primary revenue driver.
2. **Affiliate commissions:** Flights, hotels, car hire booked through embedded affiliate links. Secondary revenue.
3. **No advertising** (explicitly — user-centric positioning)

**Why $1M ARR with 5 employees is significant:** This demonstrates that a lean team can build a sustainable travel planning business. However, the ceiling is visible — to grow beyond $10M ARR, Wanderlog would need to dramatically increase its booking conversion (capturing the affiliate take rate) or scale subscribers aggressively.

**Revenue per user:** Wanderlog has been downloaded millions of times (Google Play shows 1M+ downloads). If DAU is ~100K-500K, ARPU from subscriptions alone is $2-10/user/year. This is low because most users remain on the free tier.

### 1.11 Industry Context: OTA Commission Rates

| Product | Commission / Take Rate |
|---------|----------------------|
| Hotel (Booking.com, Expedia) | 15-25% |
| Hotel (budget/independent) | Up to 30% |
| Package holiday (OTA take rate on GTV) | 8-12% |
| Flights | <5% (near zero for NDC) |
| Car hire | 8-15% |
| Transfers | 10-20% |
| Travel insurance | 15-30% |
| Experiences/activities (GetYourGuide, Viator) | 8-15% |
| Travel gear affiliate (Amazon) | 4% |

**Booking.com vs Expedia take rates:** Booking Holdings runs ~16% take rate; Expedia ~11%. The gap reflects Booking.com's European hotel-heavy mix (independent European hotels pay more than US chain hotels).

**Expedia 2024:** $110B gross bookings, $13.6B revenue = 12.4% blended take rate.

## Part 2: Revenue Stream Analysis for Holiday Portfolio

Holiday Portfolio is a UK travel personalisation engine: NLP input → semantic preference graph → curated portfolio of trips → commission-based revenue. The preference graph and portfolio are the moat. Here is a systematic analysis of every viable revenue stream.

---

### Stream 1: Booking Commission (Core Revenue)

**How it works mechanically:**

Holiday Portfolio curates a personalised portfolio of 5-10 trip recommendations for each user based on their preference graph. When a user clicks through to book, Holiday Portfolio earns a commission via:
- **Affiliate/referral:** User clicks through to LoveHolidays, Booking.com, Jet2, etc. HP earns an affiliate commission (typically 3-8% for travel OTAs, lower for flights).
- **Direct booking (later stage):** HP builds its own ATOL-licensed booking capability, capturing the full OTA margin (8-12% take rate). High barrier to entry — requires ATOL licence, supplier contracts, trust account compliance.

**Expected margin/take rate:**
- Affiliate phase: 3-8% of booking value. Average UK package holiday £1,000-2,000. Commission = £30-160 per booking.
- Direct booking phase: 8-12% take rate. Same booking value = £80-240 revenue per booking.

**When viable:**
- Affiliate: Day 1. Trivial to implement (Booking.com, Travelpayouts, TUI affiliate programmes all available immediately).
- Direct booking: Requires ATOL licence, ~£100K+ legal/compliance, supplier integrations. Year 2-3 and 10,000+ bookings/year to justify investment.

**Risks and dependencies:**
- Affiliate model means no customer data post-click (user converts on partner site)
- Affiliate commission rates can change (Booking.com famously cut affiliate rates in 2014)
- Direct booking requires significant regulatory compliance (ATOL, FCDO compliance, trust accounts)
- Flight commission has become nearly zero with NDC — hotel commission is the real money

**Evidence from competitors:** This is LoveHolidays' core (£288M), On The Beach's core (£119M), and every OTA's primary revenue. The model is proven. The differentiation is **quality of recommendation** driving conversion rate — HP's preference graph should produce higher conversion than generic search results.

---

### Stream 2: Travel Fintech Products (High-Margin Upside)

**How it works mechanically:**

Following Hopper's playbook, HP adds fintech products to the portfolio view and booking flow:

- **Portfolio Price Lock:** User loves 3 trips in their portfolio. They can lock the price of all three for 14 days for a fee (e.g., £15-25 per trip). If prices rise, HP covers up to £100/trip. If prices fall, user pays the lower price. Fee is non-refundable if user doesn't book.

- **Trip Cancellation Cover (CFAR-lite):** At point of adding a trip to portfolio, offer "Cancel for Any Reason" coverage for £30-50. If the user cancels, they get 75% back. HP takes a distribution fee (20-40% of premium); insurance partner underwrites the risk.

- **Portfolio Protect:** A bundle product — price lock + cancellation cover + disruption alerts for all trips in the portfolio. Premium £50-80 for 3 trips, valid 30 days. Bundling increases attach rate and revenue per user.

- **Fare Prediction Alerts:** Premium users get alerts when prices for portfolio trips drop below a threshold. Free in basic tier; premium feature in paid tier.

**Expected margin/take rate:**
- Price Lock: ~£20 deposit per trip × attach rate of 20-30% of viewing users = £4-6 per active user per portfolio view session. Gross margin 60-80% after predicted payout costs.
- CFAR-lite: ~£35 premium × attach rate ~10% = £3.50 per active user per booking event. Gross margin 30-40% (after insurance partner payout).
- Portfolio Protect bundle: ~£60 × attach rate 15% = £9 per active user per session. Blended margin 45-55%.

**When viable:**
- Price Lock and CFAR require insurance/fintech infrastructure: FCA authorisation (or partnership with an authorised firm), underwriting partner, claims handling. Minimum timeline: 12-18 months.
- Simpler version: Partner with an existing travel insurance provider (World Nomads, Cover-More, AXA) and earn referral commissions on their products. Viable at launch (0 months).
- Full fintech product suite: Year 2+ with FCA authorisation and 50,000+ users to build actuarial data.

**Risks and dependencies:**
- FCA authorisation required to sell insurance products in UK (significant compliance overhead)
- Actuarial risk: if HP prices Price Lock incorrectly, it absorbs losses
- Price prediction accuracy critical — errors destroy fintech margin
- User education: fintech products require explaining the value proposition (most travel bookers don't understand option pricing)

**Evidence from competitors:** Hopper earns 40% of $7.5B GMV from fintech products. 60%+ attach rate. Price Freeze and CFAR are Hopper's highest-margin products (60%+ gross margin vs ~10-15% on booking commission). This is the most exciting revenue opportunity for HP — it requires the preference graph to add the relevant intelligence layer to fintech pricing.

### Stream 3: Subscription / Premium Tier

**How it works mechanically:**

Free tier: Basic preference profile, 5 trip portfolio, affiliate booking links, standard price alerts.

Premium tier (£7.99/month or £59.99/year):
- Unlimited portfolio size (20+ trips)
- Advanced preference inputs (semantic NLP notes, not just form fields)
- Portfolio Price Lock at reduced fee (or included)
- Early access to deals before free users
- Seasonal portfolio refresh with PM-style briefing ("Your summer 2026 portfolio is ready")
- Concierge chat (async AI, not human)
- Priority price alerts (sub-1 hour vs daily digest)

**Expected margin/take rate:**
- ARPU: £59.99/year (annual) or £7.99/month (~£96/year equivalent)
- Gross margin: ~85% (LLM API costs ~£3-8/year per user at current rates; infrastructure ~£2-5/year per user)
- Churn: Target <15% annual (travel apps have highest trial-to-paid conversion at 48.7% — good starting point)

**When viable:**
- Launch as core offering: Day 1 possible, but premium is most convincing once the preference graph has demonstrably improved recommendations vs the free tier
- Recommended: Launch free tier first, build preference data for 3-6 months, then introduce premium when the graph has enough data to show differentiated value
- Target: 1,000 paid subscribers = £60K ARR (early signal), 10,000 paid = £600K ARR (meaningful)

**Risks and dependencies:**
- Subscription requires habitual engagement — users must return to HP between holidays
- The portfolio concept is naturally low-frequency (people plan 1-2 holidays/year); need to create mid-year touchpoints (price alerts, deal notifications) to maintain engagement
- Going.com demonstrates subscription works for deal alerts; HP must prove the portfolio/preference layer adds enough value beyond basic deal alerts

**Evidence from competitors:** Going.com's $49/year subscription with 2M+ subscribers demonstrates demand for premium travel deal access. Wanderlog's $79.99/year subscription hit $1M ARR with 5 staff — lean and sustainable. Travel apps have 48.7% trial-to-paid conversion — best of any app category. The model is proven at small scale; the question is whether HP's preference graph provides enough differentiated value to sustain premium.

---

### Stream 4: Sponsored Placement / Native Advertising

**How it works mechanically:**

As HP's portfolio recommendations gain user trust, hotels, airlines, and destinations would pay to be prominently featured. Two models:

1. **Sponsored portfolio position:** A hotel group pays to be included in HP's recommendation engine for users whose preference graphs match their property (e.g., "Families with children, 4-star Mediterranean beach"). Cost-per-impression or cost-per-click.

2. **Destination marketing:** A tourism board (e.g., Malta Tourism Authority, VisitPortugal) pays HP to surface their destinations prominently in portfolios when user preferences are a match. Flat fee or performance-based.

3. **Branded discovery:** Airlines pay to be the "preferred booking partner" for HP's flight referrals — getting top placement when users click through to book.

**Expected margin/take rate:**
- Travel advertising CPMs: £5-30 per 1,000 impressions for relevant audiences
- Performance-based CPC: £0.50-3.00 per click on portfolio recommendations
- At 10,000 MAU with 5 portfolio views each = 50,000 monthly portfolio views → £250-1,500/month at £5-30 CPM
- At scale (1M MAU): £25,000-150,000/month from native advertising alone

**When viable:**
- Native advertising requires scale to be compelling to advertisers
- Minimum: 50,000+ MAU to run a credible advertising pilot
- Full programme: 500,000+ MAU with well-segmented preference data
- Risk: Advertising before this scale is more distraction than revenue

**Risks and dependencies:**
- Native advertising risks poisoning the recommendation well — users chose HP for unbiased recommendations; sponsored placement undermines this if not clearly disclosed
- UK ASA rules require clear labelling of sponsored content
- Preference data segmentation makes HP ads more valuable than generic travel site ads — but the segmentation is also the moat that must be protected
- Secret Escapes uses hotel premium placement fees as a secondary revenue stream — precedent exists

**Evidence from competitors:** Secret Escapes charges hotels for premium placement. TripAdvisor's entire model is advertising-based. However, note that advertising-first models tend to compromise product quality. HP should treat this as a Phase 2/3 revenue stream, after subscription and booking commission are established.

---

### Stream 5: Anonymised Data / Insights (Approach with Caution)

**How it works mechanically:**

HP's preference graph — aggregated across thousands of users — potentially reveals:
- Emerging destination trends (which destinations are being added to portfolios before booking volumes show up)
- Budget shift signals (are users moving up-market or down-market?)
- Seasonal preference patterns
- Attribute-level demand (pool, beach, culture, city vs. countryside) broken by demographic

This data could be sold to:
- Hotel groups (where should we build next, what amenities matter?)
- Airlines (which routes are under-served vs. stated demand?)
- Tourism boards (what travellers want that we're not currently offering?)
- Travel research firms (Skift, PhocusWire, STR)

**Expected margin/take rate:**
- Data product pricing: £5,000-50,000 per bespoke research report
- API access to trend data: £2,000-10,000/month enterprise subscription
- Gross margin: ~90% (analyst time to package, minimal marginal cost)

**When viable:**
- Data product requires statistically significant sample: minimum 50,000 users with rich preference graphs to produce meaningful segmentation
- Time to meaningful dataset: 12-18 months post-launch (assuming growth)
- Ethical/legal requirement: UK GDPR Article 89 allows anonymised data for legitimate purposes; explicit consent and genuine anonymisation required

**Risks and dependencies:**
- GDPR compliance is non-trivial — user consent for data monetisation must be explicit and informed
- If users discover their preference data is being sold, trust damage is severe (see: Facebook/Cambridge Analytica as extreme example)
- The data is most valuable early (leading indicators), but HP will have the least data early
- Recommend: Build data product ambition into the privacy policy from day 1, so that future monetisation is legally grounded without requiring retrospective consent

**Evidence from competitors:** No major consumer travel platform has successfully monetised anonymised data openly. Amadeus and Sabre (B2B) sell aggregated travel data to airlines. This remains a largely untapped revenue stream for consumer travel apps — possibly because of the trust risk.

**Verdict for HP:** Real optionality here, but treat as Year 3+ and only with genuine anonymisation and explicit opt-in consent. Do not lead with this.

---

### Stream 6: Affiliate Referral (Non-Booking)

**How it works mechanically:**

Beyond flight and hotel booking, HP can earn affiliate commissions from:
- Travel insurance referrals (World Nomads, Battleface, AXA): 15-20% commission on policy premium
- Airport transfers (GetTransfer, Hoppa): 10-15% commission
- Car hire (Rentalcars.com, Kayak): 8-12% commission
- Experiences and activities (GetYourGuide, Viator): 8-15% commission
- Travel gear (affiliate links to Osprey, Patagonia, Amazon): 4-8%
- Restaurants and dining (TheFork, OpenTable): £2-5 per reservation
- Travel money / currency exchange (Wise, Revolut): referral bonus per account open £10-30

**Expected margin/take rate:**
- Travel insurance: £150 average premium × 15% commission = £22.50 per referral
- Car hire: £200 average booking × 10% = £20 per referral
- Activities: £80 average booking × 10% = £8 per referral
- Travel gear: £150 average cart × 5% = £7.50 per referral
- Blended per-trip affiliate potential (beyond core hotel/flight): £40-80 if user engages with ancillaries

**When viable:**
- Day 1 — affiliate programmes from all of the above are immediately accessible, require no supplier contracts
- Can be built into the portfolio view as "Complete Your Trip" section (transfers, insurance, packing list gear, activities at destination)

**Risks and dependencies:**
- Affiliate revenue requires user engagement beyond the initial portfolio view
- HP must have destination-specific content (activities, restaurant recommendations) to make activity affiliate revenue meaningful
- Low individual values — only meaningful at scale or when bundled with other streams

**Evidence from competitors:** Wanderlog uses affiliate links for its non-subscription revenue. Going.com earns affiliate commissions alongside subscriptions. Every travel planning tool with a monetisation model eventually adds affiliate links.

---

### Stream 7: B2B API — Preference Engine as a Service

**How it works mechanically:**

HP's semantic preference graph (the core technical IP) could be licensed as an API to:
- Other travel companies who want to improve their recommendation quality
- Airlines building personalisation into their NDC direct booking channels
- Hotel groups building personalised offers for loyalty members
- Corporate travel management companies (TMCs) wanting leisure personalisation
- Financial services embedding travel benefits (credit card travel portals)

API pricing models:
- Per-user profile call: £0.005-0.02 per API call (similar to enrichment APIs)
- Monthly active user licence: £0.50-2.00 per MAU on partner platform
- Enterprise contract: £50,000-500,000/year for unlimited usage with dedicated support

**When viable:**
- API productisation requires the preference graph to be demonstrably better than alternatives
- Minimum viable API: 18-24 months after launch, once the graph has been validated on HP's own users
- First B2B target: Airlines building NDC recommendation engines (United/Capital One invested in Mindtrip for this reason — the strategic value is high)

**Risks and dependencies:**
- API business requires enterprise sales function (expensive, slow)
- Competitor risk: Amadeus, Sabre, and major tech companies (Google, Meta) also building travel personalisation — HP's moat must be the quality of the preference graph, not just the idea
- Chicken-and-egg: B2B clients want proven technology; HP needs consumers to prove the technology

**Evidence from competitors:** Hopper's HTS accounts for 75% of Hopper's business by some measures. HTS customers include Nubank, Commonwealth Bank, Uber UK. The B2B leverage of a great consumer travel product is extremely high — but Hopper built HTS on the back of a consumer product that was already at scale. HP should plan B2B API as a Year 3-4 revenue stream.

---

### Stream 8: White-Label — Preference Engine for Airlines and Hotel Chains

**How it works mechanically:**

A step beyond API access — HP builds and operates branded preference engines for specific travel brands:

- "BA Personalised Holiday Finder powered by Holiday Portfolio technology"
- A major hotel chain's own trip planning tool, personalised to their portfolio of properties
- A financial services company's travel benefit platform with HP's preference engine underneath

Revenue model: Enterprise licensing + implementation fee + ongoing revenue share on bookings generated.

**Expected margin/take rate:**
- Implementation: £50,000-200,000 per deployment
- Annual licence: £100,000-500,000/year
- Revenue share: 10-20% of booking commission generated through the white-label

**When viable:**
- Year 3-4 minimum — requires proven consumer product, established supplier relationships, and enterprise sales capability
- Hopper's HTS trajectory: consumer product first, HTS launched ~3 years post-launch, now dominant revenue stream

**Risks:** Long sales cycles, high implementation cost, dependent on HP having unique IP that travel giants can't replicate internally. Enterprise clients are powerful buyers who will negotiate hard on margin.

## Part 3: Unit Economics Model for Holiday Portfolio

### 3.1 Revenue Per User Per Year

The model differentiates by cohort type: a **booker** (completes a booking via HP), a **premium subscriber** (pays for subscription), and a **browser** (uses HP but doesn't book or pay).

**Conservative Scenario (Year 1-2, early product, affiliate-only booking)**

| Revenue Stream | % of Users | Revenue per User | ARPU Contribution |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Affiliate booking commission | 5% of users book | £60/booking (3% on £2,000 package) | £3.00 |
| Ancillary affiliate (insurance, car hire, activities) | 3% of users | £25/referral | £0.75 |
| Premium subscription | 3% of users | £59.99/year | £1.80 |
| **Total ARPU (conservative)** | | | **£5.55/user/year** |

**Base Scenario (Year 2-3, mix of affiliate and fintech products, growing subscription)**

| Revenue Stream | % of Users | Revenue per User | ARPU Contribution |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Booking commission (affiliate) | 10% book | £75/booking | £7.50 |
| Ancillary affiliate | 6% | £35/referral | £2.10 |
| Premium subscription | 8% | £59.99/year | £4.80 |
| Fintech (Price Lock, CFAR lite via insurance referral) | 4% of users | £35/product | £1.40 |
| **Total ARPU (base)** | | | **£15.80/user/year** |

**Optimistic Scenario (Year 3-4, direct booking ATOL, fintech products, premium growth)**

| Revenue Stream | % of Users | Revenue per User | ARPU Contribution |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| Booking commission (direct, 10% take rate) | 15% book | £200/booking | £30.00 |
| Ancillary affiliate | 10% | £45/referral | £4.50 |
| Premium subscription | 15% | £59.99/year | £9.00 |
| Fintech products (Price Lock + CFAR) | 10% | £50/products | £5.00 |
| Advertising / sponsored placement | 100% (impression) | £1.50/year | £1.50 |
| **Total ARPU (optimistic)** | | | **£50.00/user/year** |

---

### 3.2 Cost Per User

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):**

Travel is a competitive CAC market. Estimates by channel:
- **Organic/SEO/content:** £2-8 CAC (slow to build, low cost at scale)
- **Referral / word of mouth:** £5-15 CAC (if referral programme exists)
- **Paid social (Instagram, TikTok, Pinterest):** £15-35 CAC for travel apps
- **Google Ads / Performance:** £25-60 CAC for travel (highly competitive)
- **PR and press:** £1-5 CAC at launch (earned media is high-value)
- **Blended CAC target (early stage):** £15-25

**LLM API Cost per User per Year:**

Based on current pricing (Claude Haiku: $0.25/1M input tokens, $1.25/1M output tokens; Claude Sonnet: $3/$15 per 1M):

For a preference graph query + portfolio generation (assume 2,000 tokens input, 1,000 tokens output per session):
- Haiku: ~£0.001/session
- Sonnet: ~£0.009/session

Active users = 10 sessions/year (weekly deal check + quarterly portfolio refresh):
- Haiku: £0.01/user/year
- Sonnet: £0.09/user/year

At scale, LLM API cost per user is **negligible** (£0.01-0.10/year). Only relevant at very high frequency or very large context windows.

**Infrastructure Cost per User per Year:**
- Cloud hosting (AWS/GCP): £0.50-2.00/user/year at 10K-100K users; <£0.50 at 500K+ users
- Database (preference graph storage): £0.10-0.50/user/year
- Email/notifications: £0.10-0.30/user/year
- Total infrastructure: **£0.70-2.80/user/year**

**Support Cost per User per Year:**
- Early stage (mostly self-serve): £0.50-1.50/user/year (largely async/email support)
- At scale with direct booking: £2-5/user/year (more complex booking queries)

**Total Cost Per User (ongoing, excluding CAC):**

| Cost Component | Conservative | Base | Optimistic |
|---------------|-------------|------|-----------|
| LLM API | £0.05 | £0.05 | £0.10 |
| Infrastructure | £2.00 | £1.50 | £1.00 |
| Support | £1.50 | £1.00 | £0.75 |
| **Total opex per user/year** | **£3.55** | **£2.55** | **£1.85** |

---

### 3.3 Gross Margin Per User

| Scenario | ARPU | Opex per User | Gross Margin | Gross Margin % |
|----------|------|---------------|--------------|----------------|
| Conservative | £5.55 | £3.55 | £2.00 | 36% |
| Base | £15.80 | £2.55 | £13.25 | 84% |
| Optimistic | £50.00 | £1.85 | £48.15 | 96% |

**Note:** Gross margin here excludes CAC and fixed team costs — it's the margin on serving an acquired user. The base and optimistic scenarios reflect strong SaaS-like gross margins because the product is mostly software.

---

### 3.4 Breakeven User Count at Different Team Sizes

**Assumptions:**
- Average UK tech salary + employers NI + benefits: £80,000/year per person
- Office/tools overhead: £10,000/person/year
- Total loaded cost per team member: £90,000/year

| Team Size | Annual Fixed Cost | Break-even Users (Base ARPU £15.80, Gross Margin £13.25) |
|-----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 3 people (solo founder + 2) | £270,000 | 20,377 users |
| 5 people | £450,000 | 33,962 users |
| 10 people | £900,000 | 67,925 users |
| 20 people | £1,800,000 | 135,849 users |
| 30 people | £2,700,000 | 203,774 users |

**At Conservative ARPU (£2.00 gross margin per user):**

| Team Size | Annual Fixed Cost | Break-even Users |
|-----------|------------------|-----------------|
| 3 people | £270,000 | 135,000 users |
| 5 people | £450,000 | 225,000 users |
| 10 people | £900,000 | 450,000 users |

**Key insight:** In the conservative/affiliate-only scenario, HP needs 135,000+ users just to cover a 3-person team — that's a hard slog for a startup. The strategic priority must be **moving from affiliate to direct booking and fintech products** as quickly as possible to improve gross margin per user from £2 to £13+, which cuts breakeven user count by 6x.

---

### 3.5 LTV:CAC Ratio Targets

**LTV calculation:**

LTV = (Gross Margin per User per Year) × (Average Years Active)

Travel users are notoriously low-retention in planning tools, but high-value when they do book. Assumptions:
- Active user lifespan in app: 2.5 years average (mix of power users at 5+ years and churned users at 1 year)
- Discount rate: 15%

| Scenario | Annual Gross Margin | LTV (2.5 years, 15% discount) |
|----------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Conservative | £2.00 | £4.35 |
| Base | £13.25 | £28.80 |
| Optimistic | £48.15 | £104.68 |

**LTV:CAC ratios at blended £20 CAC:**

| Scenario | LTV | CAC | LTV:CAC |
|----------|-----|-----|---------|
| Conservative | £4.35 | £20 | **0.22:1** — deeply loss-making |
| Base | £28.80 | £20 | **1.44:1** — still below 3:1 target |
| Optimistic | £104.68 | £20 | **5.23:1** — excellent |

**The uncomfortable truth:** At affiliate-only revenue, the unit economics don't work at typical digital marketing CAC. HP must:
1. Grow via **low-CAC organic channels** (content, SEO, referral) to reduce blended CAC to £5-10
2. Shift to **direct booking + fintech products** quickly to improve LTV
3. Build a **subscription layer** to improve predictability of revenue

**At £10 CAC (organic-heavy growth):**

| Scenario | LTV | CAC | LTV:CAC |
|----------|-----|-----|---------|
| Conservative | £4.35 | £10 | 0.44:1 — still negative |
| Base | £28.80 | £10 | **2.88:1** — approaching target |
| Optimistic | £104.68 | £10 | **10.47:1** — outstanding |

---

### 3.6 Comparison to LoveHolidays and Hopper Benchmarks

| Metric | LoveHolidays | Hopper | Holiday Portfolio (Base) | Holiday Portfolio (Optimistic) |
|--------|-------------|--------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Revenue per active booker | ~£115/booking | ~$24/user/year | £75/booker | £200/booker |
| ARPU (all users) | N/A (not disclosed) | $24.29 | £15.80 | £50.00 |
| EBITDA margin | 28.8% | Est. 15-20%* | 84% gross (pre-overhead) | 96% gross (pre-overhead) |
| Fintech % of revenue | 0% | 40% of GMV | 9% | 20% |
| Subscription % of revenue | 0% | 0% | 30% | 18% |
| Take rate on GTV | ~10% | Est. 10-12% booking + fintech | 3-8% (affiliate) | 8-12% (direct) |

*Hopper EBITDA not publicly disclosed; estimated from revenue and funding context.

**What this tells us:**

1. **LoveHolidays benchmark:** HP at £15.80 ARPU vs LoveHolidays' implied £115+ per active booker reveals the gap between a planning tool and a booking platform. The path to LoveHolidays-level economics is direct booking + ATOL licence.

2. **Hopper benchmark:** Hopper's $24 ARPU across 35M users (including many inactive users) is comparable to HP's base case. But Hopper's fintech mix (40% of GMV from fintech) is the differentiator that HP should emulate. HP's preference graph adds intelligence to fintech pricing that Hopper doesn't have.

3. **HP's advantage over Hopper:** HP knows *where* a user wants to go before they start comparing prices. This allows fintech products to be offered at the portfolio stage (before price comparison), potentially at higher attach rates than Hopper's checkout-stage upsell.
