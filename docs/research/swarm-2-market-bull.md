# Market Bull: Is there validated evidence that frequent travellers (3+ trips/year) experience real pain from planning trips individually rather than as a portfolio — and are they actively seeking or paying for solutions that offer curated, multi-trip planning with deal confidence?

Date: 2026-02-28

## Thesis

The pain is real, the behaviour change is already happening, and the money is already moving. UK adults now take an average of 3.94 holidays per year — a record high — with the 25–34 age bracket averaging 6.43 breaks annually. These are not aspirational numbers: they are the people already living a multi-trip lifestyle. Every one of those trips is planned in isolation: 303 minutes of research, 141 pages of content consumed, across OTAs, search engines, social platforms and meta-sites — multiplied nearly four times a year. The cognitive load is measurable and the market response is already in motion: travel agent usage is up (38%, its highest level since 2019), Black Tomato has a 78% repeat client rate and 90% three-year revenue growth, and a "Travel Portfolio Planner" Notion template has 10,000+ customers. People are already building annual travel plans manually and paying adjacent services to escape the pain — the product gap is the portfolio layer, not the desire for one.

## Evidence

### 1. The Portfolio Behaviour Is Already Happening at Scale

- **Claim:** UK adults are not occasional travellers — they are already running de facto travel portfolios, averaging 3.94 holidays per year (new record), with younger cohorts averaging 5–6+ breaks annually, and 14% of younger travellers reporting three or more overseas trips already booked at any one time.

- **Confidence:** 5 — Primary survey data from two independent sources, large representative samples.

### 2. Each Trip Carries a Massive, Repeated Research Burden

- **Claim:** Travellers spend an average of 303 minutes (5+ hours) consuming 141 pages of travel content per trip, across OTAs (80%), search engines (61%), and social media (58%) — and this burden is repeated for every individual trip, every time. For a 4-trips-per-year traveller, that is 20+ hours of planning effort annually, all done in fragmented, siloed sessions with no cross-trip intelligence.

### 3. Planning Stress and Decision Fatigue Are Documented, Not Just Anecdotal

- **Claim:** 52% of travellers report feeling overwhelmed by the volume of information available when planning trips (Expedia Group Media Solutions data). A MuchBetterAdventures editorial cites peer-reviewed research on "ego depletion" from travel planning decisions, 729 million+ Instagram posts tagged #travel as evidence of paradox-of-choice overload, and documents an emerging behaviour of travellers seeking "decision detoxes" — deliberately handing planning to experts to escape cognitive load.
- **Source:** Expedia Group Media Solutions cited in ["Travel Decision Fatigue: What You Need to Know"](https://www.launchyourtravels.com/travel-decision-fatigue-what-you-need/); MuchBetterAdventures ["How to Ditch Decision Fatigue and Plan Your Trips for 2026"](https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/magazine/decision-fatigue-travel-planning/); MoneySavingExpert Forum user (Ella_fella): "have used several sites recently but none of them seem to have all of the functionality and filters I need in one" — [Best package holiday comparison website thread](https://forums.moneysavingexpert.com/discussion/6630360/best-package-holiday-comparison-website)
- **Confidence:** 4 — The 52% figure is cited widely but the original Expedia Media Solutions white paper is not directly accessible; the behavioural research framing and user quotes are independently verifiable.

### 4. People Are Already Paying for Adjacent Planning Tools — The Behaviour Gap Is Closing

- **Claim:** Market adoption of paid organisational tools for travel is concrete and growing. TripIt Pro ($49/year) is specifically positioned at frequent flyers who "will save time and money a great deal more than their annual asking price." Wanderlog Pro ($79.99/year) targets users who "hit free-tier limits quickly during planning sessions." The Ultimate Travel Planner Notion template — explicitly designed for managing multiple trips annually — has over 10,000 customers on Gumroad alone. These are not aspirational purchases; they are revealed preferences.

- **Confidence:** 4 — TripIt and Wanderlog subscriber counts are not publicly disclosed, but multiple paid products with verified customer counts (10k+ template sales) confirm revealed willingness to pay.

### 5. Travel Agent Usage Is Surging Among the Exact Target Demographic — and the Reason Is Overwhelm, Not Ignorance

- **Claim:** UK travel agent bookings rose from 34% to 38% of all holidays in 2024 — the highest since 2019. Among 18–24-year-olds it rose from 36% (2019) to 48% (2024), and for young families to 55%. The primary stated reason is not inability to self-serve but "ease of booking" (54%) and "reassurance" (43%, up from 34% year-prior). This is the SAY-DO GAP closing: digitally native, self-sufficient travellers are actively choosing to delegate planning and pay for it.

- **Confidence:** 5 — This is ABTA's flagship annual survey, n=2,000 nationally representative UK adults, longitudinal tracking since 2011.

### 6. The Curated Travel Incumbents Prove Repeat-Portfolio Demand Is Monetisable

- **Claim:** Black Tomato — a UK curated luxury travel operator — has a 78% repeat client rate, 90% three-year revenue growth (Inc. 5000 recognition 2025), and a $200M valuation. Scott Dunn is described as a business where "many guests come back year after year for all their holidays." The global customised travel market is projected to grow from $400B (2023) to $600B by 2030. These are not niche signals: they are large, growing businesses whose core value proposition is exactly the multi-trip curation model being tested here — just at the luxury price point.

- **Confidence:** 4 — Black Tomato growth data confirmed by Inc. 5000 listing; repeat rate and valuation from Silicon Review profile which sources it from company data, not independently audited.

### 7. UK Travellers Are Explicitly Managing Annual Travel Budgets — and the Tools Are Primitive

- **Claim:** The Notion template marketplace has a specific category of "annual travel planning" templates — including one described as "define your yearly travel goals at the top, with trips organised by month, priority, and status (upcoming, completed, wishlist), tracking countries, ideal travel periods, and personal priority tags." The existence of a market for these templates (multiple sellers, multiple platforms including Etsy and Gumroad) demonstrates that a meaningful subset of travellers already think in annual portfolio terms and are hacking together their own tools because no commercial product meets them there.
- **Source:** Notion Marketplace travel planner category ["Travel Planner Itinerary Templates"](https://www.notion.com/templates/category/travel-planner); PathPages review ["22 Best & Free Notion Travel Templates"](https://pathpages.com/blog/6-best-notion-travel-templates); Gumroad template sales data as noted above.
- **Confidence:** 3 — Template sales volumes and the existence of the category are confirmed; but the actual volume of UK-specific purchasers and the degree to which this maps to the ProveIt target segment is inferred, not measured.

## Risks to This Position

1. **The SAY-DO gap may not be closed for mid-market:** The evidence of payment behaviour is clearest at two extremes — the $49/year app tier (very low commitment) and the luxury travel agent tier (£5,000+ holidays). The mid-market SaaS-style commission model ProveIt proposes sits in between, and there is no direct evidence yet that users in the £800–£2,500 per trip bracket will pay for curation versus simply using Google Flights and Skyscanner and tolerating the friction. The ABTA agent usage increase may reflect post-COVID reassurance-seeking rather than permanent portfolio-thinking.

2. **3.94 average trips masks a skewed distribution:** The average hides the likelihood that a minority of "super-frequent" travellers (5+ trips/year) is pulling up the mean. The 25–34 average of 6.43 breaks is striking but includes short domestic breaks. The genuinely high-value target — 3+ international trips, annual budget £3,000+, tech-savvy — may be a smaller and harder-to-reach segment than the headline number implies.

3. **The planning pain may not be felt as a "portfolio problem":** Users experience planning stress trip-by-trip, not as an aggregated annual frustration. They may not recognise that the pain is structural (doing it four times a year, isolated, from scratch each time) rather than incidental. This means the product's value proposition requires reframing the problem — a non-trivial marketing challenge — before it can convert the pain into purchase intent.

## Overall Confidence

**4** — The evidence that frequent UK travellers experience genuine, repeated planning pain and are already paying for adjacent solutions is strong and multi-sourced; the specific unmet need for a multi-trip portfolio layer (as opposed to single-trip curation or annual membership with a luxury agent) is inferred from behavioural proxies rather than directly validated demand signals.
