# Market Bull: Can a curated holiday portfolio platform generate enough booking volume and repeat usage to be a viable business?
Date: 2026-02-28

## Thesis

The curated holiday portfolio model sits at the precise intersection of three converging forces: a structurally growing outbound travel market (UK outbound at $98B, 8.6% CAGR), a generational shift toward curation over self-assembly (18-24 year-old travel agent usage nearly doubled from 26% to 48% between 2019-2024), and a repeat-booking loyalty dynamic that makes frequent travellers the highest-LTV customers in consumer commerce. No competitor has attacked the annual portfolio frame — and that absence is an opportunity, not a warning. The commission model is proven at scale by Secret Escapes (£104M revenue, 60M members), LoveHolidays (£288M revenue, 51% repeat bookings, £1B IPO in process), and Hopper ($850M revenue, 40% from fintech ancillaries). A platform that captures even a small fraction of the UK's multi-trip traveller segment, converts them into portfolio customers who book 3-4 packages in a single session, and then retains them year-on-year has a structurally higher revenue-per-user than any single-trip OTA. The unit economics are compelling: 10-15% commission on average package values of £1,500-£3,000 yields £150-£450 per booking, and a portfolio customer booking 3-4 trips generates £450-£1,800 in commission per annual cycle — from one customer acquisition event.

## Evidence

### Evidence Point 1: The Target Customer Segment Is Large, Growing, and Underserved
- **Claim:** The average British Millennial intends to take five trips in 2025. Millennials and Gen Z are expected to make up half of all holiday travellers. UK residents made 94.6 million overseas trips in 2024, up from 86.2 million in 2023 — an 8.8% single-year rise. The outbound market is projected to grow from $98.2B to $224.2B by 2035 at 8.6% CAGR.

- **Confidence:** 5

### Evidence Point 2: Curation Demand Is at a Generational High — And Validated by Revenue
- **Claim:** 18-24 year-old UK consumers booking via travel agents nearly doubled from 26% (2019) to 48% (2024). Overall, 38% of UK travellers used a travel professional in 2024, up from 34% in 2023. The top reason cited was ease of booking (54%). The travel agency services market in the UK reached £29.4B in 2024. This is not nostalgia — it is digital natives choosing structured, curated pathways over DIY complexity.

- **Confidence:** 5

### Evidence Point 3: The Commission Model at Scale Is Proven and Profitable
- **Claim:** Secret Escapes achieved £104.1M revenue and £523.8M gross bookings in 2023, with 19% YoY gross booking growth, entirely on a commission model with 60M members. LoveHolidays achieved £288M revenue and £83M adjusted EBITDA in the 12 months to October 2024, with 51% of bookings from repeat customers, and is targeting a £1B IPO. Both demonstrate that a digital-first, commission-based holiday platform can achieve sustainable operating profit and institutional-grade valuations.

- **Confidence:** 5

### Evidence Point 4: Ancillary and Fintech Revenue Creates a 40%+ Revenue Expansion Layer
- **Claim:** Hopper generated $850M in revenue in 2024 with 40% of $7.5B in bookings coming from fintech ancillary products (price freeze, cancellation protection, disruption guarantees). Over 50% of Hopper bookings now attach at least one ancillary product. A portfolio platform has a natural upsell surface: annual travel insurance, price lock on multiple bookings, flexible date products, and budget management tools — all of which can be layered on top of the base commission with no supplier negotiation required.

- **Confidence:** 4

### Evidence Point 5: Repeat Booking Rate Is the Core Moat — and the Portfolio Frame Structurally Accelerates It
- **Claim:** LoveHolidays reports 51% repeat booking rate. Bain & Company research shows repeat customers spend 67% more in year 3 than in the first 6 months. The portfolio model — where users commit to a full year of travel at the start — transforms a transactional booking into an annual planning relationship, fundamentally changing the retention dynamic. The customer who builds a portfolio in January returns to review, adjust, and rebook in a way that no single-trip OTA can replicate. Travel planner app market is growing at 11.9% CAGR, reaching $1.45T by 2032. Klarna's 2021 acquisition of Inspirock (25M annual users) specifically to embed travel planning into payments confirms that planning-to-booking conversion is a commercially validated integration.

## Risks to This Position

1. **Booking conversion from planning to transaction is historically poor.** The average American spends 18 hours researching a trip but the conversion from planning tool to booking is notoriously leaky. The portfolio platform must solve this by making the booking step feel like the natural completion of a financial planning exercise, not an afterthought. Inspirock at 25M users but only $5.5M revenue is a cautionary data point — planning at scale does not automatically mean booking revenue at scale.

2. **Commission compression from direct supplier pressure.** As Booking.com commands 30% commission from hotels, suppliers are investing heavily in direct booking channels. A new entrant without volume negotiating leverage may face thin commission rates (5-10%) rather than the 15-20% that established OTAs extract. The portfolio model's structural advantage — predictable forward booking demand — gives it genuine supplier leverage, but this needs to be demonstrated, not assumed.

3. **Seasonality and consumer budget volatility undermine the annual portfolio frame.** 33% of UK consumers say they will cut back travel spending in economic downturns, and holiday budget planning 12 months in advance is a behaviour change that requires genuine consumer trust. The platform needs to demonstrate that the portfolio is flexible (adjustable packages, price locks) rather than a commitment device that punishes users who need to change plans.

## Overall Confidence
**4** — The market size, curation tailwind, commission model precedents, and repeat-booking dynamics all support viability; the primary execution risk is converting planning engagement into booked transactions at volume, which no comparable portfolio product has yet proven at scale.
