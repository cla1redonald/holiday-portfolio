# Market Bear: Is there validated evidence that frequent travellers experience real pain from planning trips individually rather than as a portfolio — and are they actively seeking or paying for solutions that offer curated, multi-trip planning with deal confidence?
Date: 2026-02-28

## Thesis
The case for portfolio-style travel planning rests on a category error: it assumes frequent travellers experience planning as friction when the evidence strongly suggests they experience it as reward. The "pain" of individual trip planning is largely a product of low-frequency travellers who are not the target market. For tech-savvy, 3+-trips-per-year travellers — the exact segment this product courts — planning is a hobby, a source of anticipatory pleasure, and a signal of identity. The startup graveyard for curated travel is extensive and well-documented, with Phocuswright recording over 300 failures in trip planning and inspiration verticals alone. Behaviourally, this segment books spontaneously and deal-driven, resisting the up-front commitment that a portfolio model requires. The say-do gap is large: consumers consistently claim they want curation, then fail to adopt or pay for it. Free tools (Google Flights, Skyscanner, Booking.com's Genius tier) capture the deal confidence need adequately for most. There is no validated, paying market for multi-trip portfolio curation at consumer scale.

## Evidence

### Evidence Point 1: Planning Is Intrinsically Enjoyable for Frequent Travellers — Handing It Off Removes Value
- **Claim:** Psychological research consistently shows that the planning and anticipation phase of travel generates measurable happiness, often exceeding the trip itself. A 2007 study in the Journal of Experimental Psychology found people are measurably happier during vacation planning than after taking the vacation. Frequent travellers who self-select into 3+ trips per year are disproportionately likely to be the type who derive pleasure from this process. r/travel on Reddit has 12 million members and grew 32% in screen views in 2024 — this is a community actively engaged in DIY planning, not seeking to outsource it. Delegating planning to a portfolio platform removes a primary source of pre-trip satisfaction for this segment.

### Evidence Point 2: The Trip Planning Startup Graveyard Has Over 300 Recorded Failures
- **Claim:** Phocuswright, the authoritative travel research body, has documented over 300 failures specifically in the trip planning, inspiration, and itinerary-building startup category — the highest failure rate of any travel vertical. The structural problems are consistent: content requirements are enormous, user acquisition is prohibitively expensive, and retention is catastrophically low because repeat usage is rare. Utrip — which used AI personalisation to build curated itineraries, raised $4M, had 80 clients — shut down in 2019. It could not monetise or retain. TripCase, a major travel management app backed by Sabre, was sunsetted in 2025. The pattern is not isolated; it is systemic.

### Evidence Point 3: Frequent Travellers Are Spontaneous and Deal-Driven, Not Portfolio Planners
- **Claim:** American Express's 2024 Global Travel Trends Report found 78% of respondents find spontaneous trips appealing, 55% prefer no plans set in stone before travelling, and 69% prefer loose plans to remain flexible. In August 2024, 48% of total bookings were last-minute (0–7 days before departure). This is fundamentally incompatible with a model that requires committing to 3–4 holiday packages at the start of a year. The proposition asks the user to crystallise preferences and budgets upfront, which runs directly against documented booking behaviour. The 77% of millennials who have booked last-minute (cited in prior research) are not the natural users of an annual portfolio.

### Evidence Point 4: The Say-Do Gap Is Documented and Large in Travel Planning Tools
- **Claim:** Fewer than 1 in 6 Americans (15%) use AI tools to plan trips, despite broad stated interest in planning assistance. The top reasons for non-adoption: "I don't trust AI chatbots" and critically, "I don't need additional help planning my trip" — implying confidence and autonomy are active values for this demographic. Broader research on the travel say-do gap (most extensively documented in sustainability behaviour) confirms that travellers consistently overstate their intent to adopt new products and services, then revert to established platforms and behaviours. Claims of demand in surveys are structurally unreliable for nascent category creation.

- **Confidence:** 4

### Evidence Point 5: Existing Free Platforms Create High Switching Costs and Are "Good Enough"
- **Claim:** Booking.com's Genius loyalty programme locks in frequent travellers with tiered rewards (Level 2 at 5 bookings, Level 3 at 15 bookings within two years), with discounts and rewards that persist for life once unlocked. These programmes create genuine switching costs that a new commission-based portfolio tool must overcome. Google Flights and Skyscanner are free, fast, and well-understood by the exact tech-savvy demographic this product targets. Despite the narrative that no single tool is sufficient, the practical reality is that frequent travellers have assembled their own multi-platform stack they are comfortable with and see no need to pay to replace. TripCase's sunset in 2025 shows that even enterprise-backed tools struggle to retain users against free alternatives and direct OTA apps.

### Evidence Point 6: AI Travel Concierge Acquisition by Amex Reveals the Product Is Enterprise, Not Consumer
- **Claim:** Mezi — arguably the highest-profile AI travel concierge startup — was acquired by American Express in January 2018. Immediately post-acquisition, Amex directed Mezi to wind down all consumer-facing and travel management company relationships. The product was absorbed into Amex's corporate travel infrastructure, not scaled as a consumer offering. This is the defining signal: even when a well-funded, well-designed AI concierge is acquired by one of the world's largest financial services companies with a premium travel-card customer base, the verdict was that the consumer market was not the right surface. The pain exists at enterprise/corporate travel level; it does not translate to self-serve consumer portfolio planning.

## Risks to This Position

1. **Affluent segment may behave differently.** The spontaneous booking data and say-do gap research skews toward broad consumer populations. High-income, time-poor frequent travellers (the explicit target here) may genuinely feel planning fatigue rather than planning pleasure. The bear case is weakest when applied to households earning £150k+ who travel business class and treat planning as genuinely costly. There is anecdotal evidence this segment does pay for concierge services — though through luxury travel advisors, not SaaS platforms.

2. **The portfolio framing is novel enough to sidestep direct comparisons.** Every failed startup listed attempted to solve the single-trip planning problem. None attempted the annual budget allocation and portfolio optimisation angle. It is possible the market has not failed at this specific idea yet because no one has built it clearly enough — the failure data may not be directly analogous.

3. **Commission model means the consumer bears no explicit cost.** Several of the bear arguments assume the user must pay out-of-pocket. If the product is genuinely free-to-the-consumer (commission from suppliers), the willingness-to-pay objection dissolves and the adoption barrier is lower. The question becomes whether commission economics can work at the scale required — a viability question, not a demand question.

## Overall Confidence
**4** — The evidence that frequent travellers enjoy planning, that the startup graveyard in this vertical is exceptionally well-populated, and that spontaneous/deal-driven behaviour dominates the target segment is robust and multi-sourced. The bear position holds strongly on behavioural grounds even if some edge-case affluent segments may partially validate the pain.
