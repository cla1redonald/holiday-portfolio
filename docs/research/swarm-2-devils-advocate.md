# Devil's Advocate: Is there validated evidence that frequent travellers (3+ trips/year) experience real pain from planning trips individually rather than as a portfolio — and are they actively seeking or paying for solutions that offer curated, multi-trip planning with deal confidence?
Date: 2026-02-28

## Thesis

The bull case for a curated holiday portfolio planner rests on survey statistics that are largely industry-commissioned, methodologically weak, and almost certainly capture the wrong population. The target customer — tech-savvy self-serve travellers taking 3+ trips a year — is precisely the segment most likely to enjoy planning, treat it as a hobby, and actively resist delegation. Planning fatigue is real for the mass-market infrequent traveller, not for frequent travellers. The pain that does exist among frequent travellers is better addressed by improved search and AI assistants than by curation and portfolio packaging. Commission-based curated recommendations face a structural trust problem that the target demographic is especially equipped to recognise. The graveyard of failed trip-planning startups — hundreds of them — demonstrates that consumers rarely pay for planning tools even when they report planning is stressful. The headline statistics (71% find booking stressful, 16 hours per trip, 90% want personalisation) collapse on inspection: they are self-reported, incentivised, and drawn from general populations that include people who travel once a year, not the specific segment this product targets.

## Evidence

### Evidence Point 1: Planning Is a Source of Pleasure, Not Just Stress — Especially for Frequent Travellers

- **Claim:** Research consistently shows that the planning and anticipation phase generates measurable happiness benefits, and that frequent travellers are more likely to experience planning as an enjoyable, identity-forming activity rather than a burden they want to delegate.

- **Confidence:** 4

A 2010 study found vacationers experienced their highest happiness boost during the planning stage — not the trip itself. The anticipation mechanism (dopamine release during forward-looking mental simulation) is well-documented. Critically, industry analysts at PhocusWire explicitly note that most people "actually enjoy trip planning — they enjoy researching the destination, things to do and see. It can be fun. It builds excitement and anticipation." This is not a fringe view; it is the consensus among travel industry researchers as an explanation for why planning startups repeatedly fail. The frequent traveller who takes 3+ trips per year has turned this into a practiced hobby. Delegating it to a platform removes the anticipation benefit, not just the effort cost.

### Evidence Point 2: The "16 Hours" and "71% Stress" Statistics Are Industry-Commissioned and Methodologically Suspect

- **Claim:** The headline statistics underpinning the bull case are generated by companies with commercial interests in making planning look painful, and are drawn from general adult populations, not the frequent-traveller segment this product targets.
- **Source:** [Priceline Press Center — 16 hours statistic](https://press.priceline.com/new-priceline-research-finds-average-traveler-spends-two-full-work-days-to-plan-and-book-trips/); [CivicScience — Americans Stressed Over Travel Planning](https://civicscience.com/as-vacation-season-heats-up-many-americans-are-feeling-stressed-over-travel-planning/); [IBS Software survey — travel agent comeback](https://www.ibsplc.com/news/survey-surprising-trends-among-the-youngest-travelers-as-47-of-americans-turn-toward-travel-agents-to-book-their-holiday-travel)
- **Confidence:** 4

The "16 hours per trip" figure originates from a Priceline press release — Priceline being an OTA that profits from positioning planning as burdensome. It was conducted by The Harris Poll and is not peer-reviewed. The IBS Software survey (cited in the travel agent comeback narrative) was conducted online among 2,000 US adults "considering a vacation for Christmas/New Year" — a heavily self-selected holiday-season sample that is unrepresentative of year-round frequent travellers. The "71% find booking stressful" figure similarly aggregates infrequent and frequent travellers together. There is no validated, peer-reviewed study isolating frequent travellers (3+ trips/year) and finding they experience planning as a persistent pain requiring a portfolio solution.

### Evidence Point 3: The Trip Planning Startup Graveyard Is Extensive and the Failure Modes Are Structural

- **Claim:** Hundreds of trip-planning startups have failed over the past decade, and their failure is not primarily a technology problem — it is a consumer behaviour problem. Consumers report stress but do not pay for planning tools.
- **Source:** [PhocusWire — Why trip-planning startups struggle](https://www.phocuswire.com/trip-planning-startups-Phocuswright-Accenture); [PhocusWire — Can trip planning startups ever succeed?](https://www.phocuswire.com/opinion-can-trip-planning-startups-ever-succeed); [Failory — 9 Failed Travel Startups](https://www.failory.com/startups/travel-failures); [TNMT — Travel startup graveyard](https://tnmt.com/startup-graveyard/); [Phocuswright — Tripped Up: Why Trip Planning Startups Stumble](https://www.phocuswright.com/Events/Webinars/Tripped-Up-Why-Trip-Planning-Startups-Stumble)
- **Confidence:** 5

Phocuswright's database tracks approximately 700 companies in the inspiration/research/itinerary space, with around 300 recorded failures — the highest failure rate of any travel vertical. In 2024 alone, startups focused on inspiration, planning, and booking saw failure rates nearly double those of other travel segments. The structural diagnosis is consistent across analysts: (1) consumers are positioned at the top of the funnel before transactions happen, making monetisation difficult; (2) OTAs and metasearch platforms have competitive moats and have all integrated AI planning features; (3) most people enjoy planning and don't need a substitute. AI-specific examples — Tripnotes (viral then shut down 2023), Utrip (personalised itineraries, AI recommendation engine too costly to maintain), Desti (users found it useful but booked elsewhere) — illustrate that even technically capable products fail to capture commercial value. The core failure mode is that "consumers are pretty comfortable with Google" and the existing search infrastructure is not broken enough to justify a new intermediary.

### Evidence Point 4: The Autonomy Research Directly Undermines the Curation Value Proposition

- **Claim:** Academic research on autonomy in trip planning finds that planning autonomy is directly correlated with travel satisfaction, and that the control premium — willingness to sacrifice expected value for personal control — means target customers will resist delegation even when delegation produces superior outcomes.
- **Source:** [Tandfonline — Autonomy in trip planning and overall satisfaction](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10548408.2017.1350250); [AEA — The Control Premium: A Preference for Payoff Autonomy](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/mic.6.4.138); [Emerald — Resistance to AI-designed customized travel](https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/tr-09-2024-0824/full/pdf?title=resistance-to-ai-designed-customized-travel-the-role-of-perceived-personalization)
- **Confidence:** 4

A peer-reviewed study in the Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing (2017) found a direct positive relationship between trip planning autonomy and overall satisfaction — and crucially, that tourists with more previous travel experience (the exact target market) derive greater satisfaction from autonomous planning, not less. The economic literature on the control premium (Owens, Grossman, Fackler) found that individuals sacrifice 8–15% of expected asset earnings to retain personal control over decisions. In the travel context, this means the target customer will prefer a slightly worse trip they chose themselves over a slightly better trip a platform chose for them. Emerging 2025 research on resistance to AI-designed customised travel confirms this pattern: AI acceptance as a travel designer "remains uncertain despite advantages in efficiency and cost reduction."

### Evidence Point 5: The Target Customer (Tech-Savvy Frequent Traveller) Is the Segment Least Likely to Want Curation

- **Claim:** Frequent, tech-savvy travellers are the demographic most likely to engage in DIY research, travel hacking, and complex multi-platform booking strategies — behaviours that are incompatible with delegating to a curation platform.
- **Source:** [TGM Research — Global Travel Insights 2025](https://tgmresearch.com/global-travel-insights-2025.html); [The Points Guy — travel hacking guides](https://thepointsguy.com/loyalty-programs/otas-earn-airline-miles/); [YouGov — Comfort with AI in travel planning dips among younger Americans](https://yougov.com/en-us/articles/52770-comfort-with-ai-in-travel-planning-dips-among-younger-americans)
- **Confidence:** 3

Global travel insights show that over 62% of European travellers prefer self-planning, with DIY preference highest in the most digitally advanced markets. The travel hacking community (r/churning, The Points Guy, award-booking culture) represents a concentrated version of the target demographic — high-income, tech-savvy, 3+ trips per year — and this segment treats complexity as a feature, not a bug. They optimise across loyalty programmes, credit card sign-up bonuses, award seat availability, and airline alliance routing rules. Delegating booking to a commission-based platform would sacrifice points earning (OTA bookings often forego hotel loyalty points entirely), undermine elite status strategies, and remove the satisfaction of personally finding a deal. YouGov (2025) data shows comfort with AI travel planning is actually declining: 30% comfortable, down from 32% the prior year, with 40% explicitly uncomfortable. Among the younger tech-savvy segment the product targets, male traveller comfort dropped from 39% to 34% between 2024 and 2025.

### Evidence Point 6: Commission-Based Curation Creates a Structural Trust Problem That the Target Market Will Identify

- **Claim:** Tech-savvy frequent travellers are more aware of conflicts of interest in commission-based recommendations than the general population, and evidence suggests consumer distrust of curated/algorithmic recommendations is a real adoption barrier.
- **Source:** [ScienceDirect — Will tourists take mobile travel advice? The personalization-privacy paradox](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1447677022000195); [Wiley — Resistance to AI-Generated Travel Advice (2025)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jtr.70082); [UX Mate — The Personalization Dilemma](https://www.uxmate-blog.com/2024/12/15/the-personalization-dilemma-how-much-control-should-users-have/)
- **Confidence:** 3

Research on AI-generated travel advice (2025) identifies consistent scepticism about recommendation reliability "particularly when decisions involve cost, safety, or time-sensitive details." A travel platform earning commission on bookings it recommends faces the same trust problem as a commissioned financial advisor or estate agent: the target customer reasonably asks whether packages are curated for their benefit or the platform's margin. This is amplified by the target demographic being tech-savvy — these are users who understand how OTA commission structures work, who know that hotel loyalty points are forfeited when booking through intermediaries, and who read coverage of affiliate marketing conflicts. The travel agent "comeback" narrative, to the extent it reflects a real signal, appears driven by consumers overwhelmed by complexity — a different segment from frequent, experienced self-planners.

## Risks to This Position

1. **The portfolio framing may be genuinely novel.** Most failed trip-planning startups targeted single-trip planning. The "annual portfolio" framing — setting a yearly budget and building 3–4 trips holistically rather than individually — could address a distinct coordination problem that existing tools do not. A frequent traveller who must balance dates, budget, leave allowance, and destination variety across a year might value integrated portfolio management even if they enjoy per-trip research. This is an untested use case and should not be conflated with generic planning-tool failures.

2. **The travel agent comeback data, even if methodologically imperfect, reflects a directional shift.** Multiple independent sources (IBS Software, ASTA, travel agency owner reports) indicate growth in agent usage among younger travellers. If this reflects genuine willingness to delegate complex trip orchestration — even at a premium — the control-premium argument may be weaker than the academic literature suggests for complex, multi-trip coordination specifically.

3. **The "deal confidence" pain may be real but understated in research.** Price volatility in flight and accommodation markets is high, and fare regret is a documented phenomenon. If the product can credibly demonstrate it locks in value across a portfolio of trips at a time when prices are favourable, the confidence benefit could be genuinely differentiated from search tools — which surface prices but do not confer certainty or commit to a plan.

## Overall Confidence

**4** — The counter-evidence is strong and structurally consistent: the target customer (frequent, tech-savvy traveller) is the segment most likely to enjoy planning, least likely to trust commission-based curation, and best equipped to navigate existing search tools. The key bull-case statistics are industry-commissioned and aggregated across the wrong population. The startup graveyard is large and the failure modes are well-documented. A score of 5 is withheld because the portfolio-planning framing is genuinely novel and has not been validated or invalidated by prior startups, meaning the devil's advocate case applies strongly to the generic "trip planning tool" category but with somewhat less certainty to the specific annual-portfolio-with-deal-locking model.
