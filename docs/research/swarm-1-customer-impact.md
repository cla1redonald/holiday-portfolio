# Customer Impact: Can a curated holiday portfolio platform — targeting tech-savvy self-serve travellers who take 3+ trips/year, with commission-based revenue on packaged bookings — generate enough booking volume and repeat usage to be a viable business, given that no portfolio-based travel product has been proven at scale?
Date: 2026-02-28

## Thesis

There is a documented, growing appetite among tech-savvy frequent travellers for curation that reduces cognitive load — not because these users cannot plan, but because the planning process has become sufficiently fragmented and time-intensive that even capable planners experience burnout. The evidence shows that 71% of British holidaymakers find booking stressful, 97% report being happier when a trip is planned for them, and the resurgence of travel agents among Millennials and Gen Z (38% now prefer agents vs 12% of Gen X) signals a structural shift in where trust is placed. A curated portfolio platform targeting the 3+ trips/year segment would intercept users at a moment of genuine frustration — not manufactured anxiety — which is a strong foundation for both initial conversion and repeat usage. The core risk is the "say-do gap": travellers enthusiastically endorse curation in surveys but frequently revert to self-planning when the actual booking moment arrives, driven by a persistent desire for control and a fear that pre-packaged options will not reflect their specific preferences.

## Evidence

### Booking Stress Is Endemic and Measurable
- **Claim:** 71% of British holidaymakers find at least one part of the booking process stressful; 70% of US vacation bookers describe the booking experience as stress-inducing. The average traveller conducts up to 48 searches before booking.

- **Confidence:** 4

### Planning Anticipation Creates Happiness — But the Process Is Abandoned
- **Claim:** 97% of travellers report that having a trip planned makes them happier. However, the majority of users lose interest in the planning process within 42 minutes and many abandon trip plans entirely because the research process is "too tiring." This creates a strong wedge a curation platform can fill: users want the outcome (planned trip, happiness boost) without the process (48 searches, 16 hours of research).

- **Confidence:** 4

### Younger, Frequent Travellers Are Already Turning to Curation
- **Claim:** 38% of Gen Z and Millennials prefer using a travel agent over self-planning — more than three times the 12% of Gen Xers who do the same. In the UK, 18-24 year olds using travel agents nearly doubled (26% to 48%). Millennials average approximately 3.5 trips/year. The target user segment is not hypothetical; it is actively self-selecting toward curated services.

### Frequent Travellers Have Distinct Behavioural Traits That Favour Curation
- **Claim:** Frequent leisure travellers (3+ trips/year) skew toward higher income (34% earn $100k+), rely heavily on loyalty and rewards programs (80%+ use airline and hotel rewards), and are described as motivated by reliability, consistency, and brand trust — not just price. This cohort is less likely to defect on price alone and more likely to stay with a platform that consistently delivers quality experiences. 80% of OTA users in 2023 transacted via a single platform, showing strong platform stickiness once trust is established.

- **Confidence:** 3

### Personalisation Demonstrably Improves Repeat Booking
- **Claim:** McKinsey data (2024) shows 78% of consumers are more likely to make a repeat purchase when offered a personalised experience based on their data. Epsilon research finds that 80% of customers are more likely to engage with businesses offering personalised services. Loyalty programs with personalised, curated offers see up to 47% higher engagement than generic points systems. These figures are from adjacent loyalty contexts but directly apply to a platform whose product is personalised year-round travel planning.

- **Confidence:** 3

### OTA Satisfaction Is Structurally Declining, Creating a Window
- **Claim:** The ACSI Travel Study 2025 shows every major OTA declined in satisfaction — Booking.com (78, -3%), Expedia (77, -3%), Kayak (69, -5%), Orbitz (66, -10%). The study attributes this to "airlines and hotels improving their own website experiences," with more customers bypassing OTAs. This represents a trust and differentiation vacuum that a curation-first platform could occupy, particularly for travellers who want more than a search engine.

## Risks to This Position

### The Say-Do Gap Is Well-Documented in Travel
The strongest risk is that consumer stated preference and actual booking behaviour diverge significantly in travel. Research on the "control premium" shows that users are 20% more likely to choose to control their payoff than a group of optimisers with accurate beliefs — even when delegation would produce better outcomes. HN forum data confirms this: many self-described frequent travellers enjoy planning as a hobby and would resist handing it over. A curated portfolio may convert users who are genuinely burned out but will lose users whose stated frustration is actually a performance of sophistication rather than a real pain point. This is difficult to detect in early user interviews.

### Trust Transfer Risk at the Portfolio Level
Travel recommendations are highly personal and a single bad trip in a curated portfolio — a hotel that did not match expectations, poor timing of a city break relative to a local event — could damage trust in all future recommendations. The research on travel agent resurgence also notes that Gen Z simultaneously exhibits lower trust in all industries than older generations. Unlike a search engine (where the OTA deflects blame to the supplier), a portfolio platform is explicitly accountable for quality. A bad experience in trip two of a four-trip portfolio could trigger full churn, not just reduced engagement.

### Upfront Commitment May Not Match Booking Behaviour Reality
The portfolio model assumes users will commit annual travel budgets and preferences in advance. Research shows the average path to purchase involves 71 days of research with heavy use of inspiration-phase browsing. Frequent travellers who have 80%+ loyalty program usage are also making trip decisions in response to deals, reward redemption windows, and impulse triggers — not through structured annual planning sessions. The platform's design assumption (annual budget, pre-set preferences, 3-4 packages) may conflict with how frequent travellers actually decide to travel, which is often opportunistic rather than pre-planned.

## Overall Confidence
**3** — Customer demand for curation among frequent travellers is real and growing, supported by multiple convergent data sources, but the specific "portfolio" framing has no proven analogues at scale and the gap between stated preference and booking behaviour in travel is consistently larger than in other consumer categories.
