# Customer Impact: Is there validated evidence that frequent travellers (3+ trips/year) experience real pain from planning trips individually rather than as a portfolio — and are they actively seeking or paying for solutions that offer curated, multi-trip planning with deal confidence?

Date: 2026-02-28

## Thesis

Frequent UK travellers demonstrate the pain of fragmented, trip-by-trip planning through revealed preference — not through stated preference surveys. They pay for annual multi-trip insurance at scale, adopt organisation tools like TripIt at 20 million users, build Notion templates to manage annual portfolios, and concentrate a disproportionate share of annual bookings into a single day (Sunshine Saturday, January). The behaviour that most directly validates the portfolio problem is this: 20% of all UK travellers had booked two or more international trips for 2025 before the end of 2024, and 14% of younger travellers had booked three or more — yet no tool exists to help them do this intelligently as a budget-aware annual portfolio. The pain is real, the budget commitment is real, but the coordination layer is entirely missing, which is why the planning remains fragmented across spreadsheets, forums, and travel agents.

## Evidence

### Evidence Point 1: The January Concentration Signal — People Plan Annually, Not Trip-by-Trip

- **Claim:** A measurable spike in holiday bookings every January (Sunshine Saturday) demonstrates that a large segment of travellers plans their entire travel year in one window, not reactively trip-by-trip. 35% of UK holidaymakers book in January. ATOL reported 4.3 million ATOL-protected holidays booked in January 2025 alone. For January 2026, agencies across the UK reported a 60% increase in bookings compared to the prior year. TUI logged approximately 40,000 bookings in a single 24-hour period on Sunshine Saturday.

- **Confidence:** 4

### Evidence Point 2: Advance Multi-Trip Booking Is Already Happening Without a Portfolio Tool

- **Claim:** 20% of all UK travellers had booked two or more international trips for 2025 before the end of 2024. Among 16-24-year-olds, 14% had booked three or more holidays for the following year, and 58% of that cohort had already booked overseas trips during 2024 for 2025. This is portfolio-level commitment — allocating annual travel budget across multiple future trips — done entirely without purpose-built tooling. The money is being committed; the coordination layer is absent.

- **Confidence:** 4

### Evidence Point 3: TripIt's 20 Million Users Signal Scale of the Organisation Problem

- **Claim:** TripIt, a $49/year tool that does nothing except consolidate confirmation emails into a unified itinerary, has reached approximately 20 million users (from 1 million at its 2011 Concur acquisition). The existence of this paid tier, sustained over 15 years, demonstrates that a material population of frequent travellers is willing to pay explicitly for travel organisation — not booking, not curation, just coordination. FlyerTalk forum members recommend TripIt as the default for "managing lots of trips," with users describing persistent pain around phantom trip data, cancellation handling, and the inadequacy of free-tier alternatives.

- **Confidence:** 3 — the 20 million figure is drawn from third-party revenue aggregators and is unverified by SAP Concur directly; the behavioural signal (sustained $49/yr subscription) is robust, but its relevance to portfolio planning specifically (rather than individual trip tracking) is partial

### Evidence Point 4: Travel Agents Are Resurging Precisely Because Planning Is Genuinely Hard

- **Claim:** More than a third (36%) of UK consumers used a travel agent in the past 12 months, rising to 53% in households with joint income above £75,000. The proportion of 18-24-year-olds using agents rose from 26% in 2019 to 48% in 2024. The top reasons given: time-saving (40%), trusted expert advice (38%), support if something goes wrong (35%), and personalised packages (44%). This is the closest direct behavioural analogue to the product idea — people are paying agent commissions specifically to outsource the portfolio-construction work. The fact that high-income, digitally-native younger travellers are increasing agent usage is a strong counter-intuitive behavioural signal.

- **Confidence:** 5 — this is third-party survey data from an industry body, with consistent corroboration across multiple sources

### Evidence Point 5: Planning Time Is a Real Burden — Average 18 Hours Per Trip

- **Claim:** The average traveller spends approximately 18 hours researching, comparing prices, and booking a single trip (Priceline/independent research). Expedia Group data shows travellers view 141 pages of travel content in the 45 days before booking. For a frequent traveller taking 3-4 trips annually, this is 54-72 hours of planning time per year. 47% of adults explicitly say that reduced planning time would reduce their life stress. Travel apps have a 30-day retention rate of just 5% — users abandon them immediately after the trip they booked, confirming that no tool currently retains users across the multi-trip planning cycle.

- **Confidence:** 4

### Evidence Point 6: Annual Multi-Trip Insurance as Proxy for Repeat Booking Scale

- **Claim:** Annual multi-trip travel insurance is reported to command approximately 80% of the UK travel insurance market share (with the overall market at ~£980m in 2024). Even using the conservative 60.49% single-trip figure that contradicts this, the annual multi-trip segment still represents hundreds of millions of pounds in premiums. Every annual multi-trip policy represents a behavioural commitment: someone who expects to take multiple trips within a 12-month window and has pre-committed budget accordingly. This is a direct proxy for the size of the population the product targets.

- **Confidence:** 3 — the 80% market share figure is from a single industry report and conflicts with other data; the directional signal (annual multi-trip is large) is solid, the precise magnitude is uncertain

## Risks to This Position

1. **The say-do gap runs the other way on curation.** People paying for TripIt are paying for organisation of trips they have already decided to take — not for a curated portfolio that recommends and bundles trips they haven't chosen yet. The behavioural evidence shows pain with coordination and time; it does not show willingness to outsource the actual trip selection to a platform. The jump from "I want help organising my trips" to "I want an algorithm to design my annual travel portfolio" is large and unvalidated by the evidence found.

2. **Travel agents satisfy the curation need already, and trust is a moat.** The 44% of UK travellers who prefer agents for "tailored advice and personalised packages" are already getting a curated, portfolio-like service from human experts. The resurging agent adoption among younger, higher-income travellers — the exact target demographic — suggests the market is solving the curation problem through incumbents. A commission-based platform would need to demonstrate trustworthiness that agents have built over decades of repeat relationships.

3. **Deal confidence may be structurally difficult to provide.** A core part of the stated product value is "deal confidence" — users trusting that the platform has found genuinely good prices. The MoneySavingExpert data and broader cost-of-living research shows that UK travellers are price-sensitive and actively hunt deals themselves (spending more time searching for good deals is their primary cost-reduction strategy). A commission-based model creates an inherent conflict of interest that sophisticated, frequent travellers may identify: the platform earns more when users book more expensive trips, which directly undermines deal confidence credibility.

## Overall Confidence

**3** — The pain of fragmented, time-intensive, uncoordinated multi-trip planning is real and well-evidenced through behavioural proxies (agent adoption, planning time data, Sunshine Saturday concentration, TripIt scale). However, the specific value proposition — curated portfolio with deal confidence on a commission model — has a structural trust problem and faces a well-established incumbent (travel agents) who already serve the curation need for the highest-value customers in the target segment.
