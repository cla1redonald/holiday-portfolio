# Market Bear: Can a curated holiday portfolio platform generate enough booking volume and repeat usage to be a viable business?
Date: 2026-02-28

## Thesis

The curated holiday portfolio model sits at the intersection of three historically brutal failure modes in consumer travel: trip-planning tools that fail to capture the booking moment, subscription-adjacent models that collapse under churn, and commission-based revenue structures that are being systematically compressed by incumbent OTAs and Google. Every structural advantage the idea claims — curation, annual planning, portfolio optimisation — is either being replicated by Booking.com and Airbnb with AI features and existing user bases of hundreds of millions, or has already been tried by better-funded predecessors who are now dead. The market is not waiting to be unlocked; it has already been tried repeatedly and the signal from those attempts is unambiguous: consumers treat travel planning as a free utility and book where they already have accounts, loyalty points, and price confidence.

## Evidence

### Evidence Point 1: The Planning-to-Booking Leakage Problem Has Never Been Solved
- **Claim:** The central business risk is that users will plan on the platform but book elsewhere, destroying the commission revenue model before any scale is achieved. This is not theoretical — it is the documented cause of death of Desti and directly threatened every trip-planning startup that preceded this one. A 2013 Expedia study found consumers visit up to 38 travel sites before booking. There is no evidence that locking planning into a single portfolio view changes this behaviour.

- **Confidence:** 5

### Evidence Point 2: Booking.com and Airbnb Are Already Building This Feature
- **Claim:** Booking.com launched an AI Trip Planner in October 2024, built in partnership with OpenAI, that handles destination discovery, accommodation selection, and itinerary creation. Airbnb uses ML to personalise recommendations based on behavioural history. These incumbents have 500M+ registered users, supplier relationships, existing trust, loyalty ecosystems, and near-zero marginal cost to add portfolio-style planning. A startup must spend years acquiring users that Booking.com already owns.

### Evidence Point 3: The Only Public Comparable — Inspirato — Is a Cautionary Tale
- **Claim:** Inspirato, the closest public-market analogue to a curated, subscription-style travel experience company, is in financial distress. It posted a net loss of $29M in 2023, subscription revenue fell 30% YoY in Q2 2024, active subscriptions dropped from 16,100 to 13,800 in 12 months, and the company executed a reverse stock split to avoid delisting. Crucially, 40% of nights were booked by just 20% of members — indicating extreme concentration risk and low broad engagement, not the repeat portfolio behaviour this model depends on.

- **Confidence:** 5

### Evidence Point 4: Commission Margins Are Too Thin to Support the CAC Required to Reach Scale
- **Claim:** Hotel commissions run 10–25%, flights 5–8%, with holiday packages up to 25% in favourable conditions. But OTAs already pay Booking.com and Google for customer acquisition — Booking Holdings and Expedia spent nearly $3 billion on Google ads in 2021 alone. A startup without their scale would face a worse CAC/LTV ratio. Secret Escapes, a curated travel flash-sale site with £104.7M revenue, posted an £8M EBITDA and a £500K operating loss on £535.7M gross bookings. That is a net take rate of approximately 1.5% of gross bookings actually reaching profit — before the cost of acquiring a new customer who books 3-4 trips per year across multiple destinations through a new, unproven platform.

- **Confidence:** 4

### Evidence Point 5: Travel Startup Funding Has Collapsed and the Graveyard Is Full
- **Claim:** Travel startup funding dropped 40% in Q1 2025 versus Q1 2024, hitting a near 10-year low. The startup graveyard includes Desti (AI travel planning, dead), Utrip (personalised itineraries, dead), Hitlist (trip planning app, dead), FinalPrice ("Amazon Prime of travel", raised $4M, dead by 2018), PlanMyTripASAP (AI travel planning, recently shut), and Wayfind (AI itinerary builder, recently shut). Companies focused on inspiration, planning, and booking platforms saw close to 3% closure rates in 2024 — almost double other travel segments. Hacker News consensus is that travel planning is "the most common bad startup idea."

## Risks to This Position

1. **The portfolio frame is genuinely novel.** None of the failed predecessors structured the product as an annual budget optimisation engine rather than a single-trip planner. If the planning lock-in comes from committing a yearly budget upfront — analogous to a gym membership or annual subscription — the leakage problem might be partially contained. This is untested but not obviously wrong.

2. **The target segment (tech-savvy, 3+ trips/year) is high-LTV if retention holds.** A user taking four trips a year at an average booking value of £1,500 per trip represents £6,000 in gross bookings annually. At even a 10% net commission, that is £600 per retained user per year. If CAC can be held below £200 through word-of-mouth and content, the unit economics could work for a niche business — just not a venture-scale one.

3. **Incumbent AI features exist but are shallow.** Booking.com's AI Trip Planner as of late 2024 is a chatbot layered on search, not a portfolio optimiser. The gap between "chatbot recommends destinations" and "platform allocates your annual travel budget across 4 optimised packages with dynamic pricing" is real. A focused startup could execute the latter more deliberately than an OTA feature team with competing priorities.

## Overall Confidence

**4** — The structural headwinds (planning-to-booking leakage, incumbent AI feature buildout, thin commission margins relative to CAC, a decade of comparable failures, collapsed funding environment) are severe and well-evidenced; the bear case is strong, but the specific portfolio-as-annual-commitment framing has not been directly disproven because it has not been tried.
