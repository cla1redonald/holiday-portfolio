# Roami — Tone of Voice Guide

## Core Voice Pillars

The "Voice" is our permanent personality. It never changes.

- **Wonder-Full:** We celebrate the magic of discovery. Evocative, sensory language that makes users feel the "itch" to travel.
- **Radically Simple:** Travel is complex; Roami is not. Short sentences, plain English. If a ten-year-old can't understand it, rewrite it.
- **Quietly Confident:** We are experts, but we don't brag. No hype, no "MARKETING SCREAMING." Calm assurance of someone who already has the tickets printed.

## The Golden Rule

**Don't just give directions; give directions to a friend.** If it sounds like a lawyer or robot wrote it, delete it. If it sounds like a well-travelled friend who wants you to have the best day of your life, keep it.

## Mission Copy

### Our Mission

> To help the world roam with heart.

We believe that travel shouldn't be a checklist or a spreadsheet. It's the feeling of a cold morning in a new city, the taste of a kitchen you've never visited, and the quiet confidence of knowing exactly where you are — even when you're "lost."

Our mission is to strip away the friction of the journey so you can find the soul of the destination. We're here to turn "trips" into "stories" and "tourists" into "locals," one smart flight and hidden gem at a time.

### The Roami Story

**Born from a love for the long way around.**

Most travel apps feel like robots. They're great at counting pennies and booking seats, but they often forget the most important part: you.

Roami started with a simple realisation: the best parts of travel usually happen when the logistics get out of the way. We wanted a companion that felt like a well-travelled friend — someone who knows the visa requirements like the back of their hand, but also knows exactly which alleyway leads to the best sunset in Lisbon.

So, we built it.

Roami is a collection of tools designed for the modern wanderer. We combined smart, AI-driven planning with a heartbeat for authentic discovery. Whether you're chasing horizons solo or coordinating a crew, we're here to make sure every mile feels effortless.

We don't just want you to see the world; we want you to feel at home in it.

**Welcome to Roami. Your world, better explored.**
